## Concept
Our project, "Orbits on a Budget" (also known as OBI Orbitar), aims to create a manual and design for the Orbitar that can be built with a minimal budget and conventional tools. We plan to incorporate services like Zuschnittservice at Baumarkt and recycled wood into our design process. This concept prioritizes cost-efficiency over convenience or advanced functions, providing ample opportunities for quality improvement or specific function focus during the construction process.

## Design Idea: The ObiOrbita
Our design emphasizes the easy manufacturing and assembly of a working Orbita design. We plan to utilize off-the-shelf hardware where possible. Other parts should be easy to manufacture with common household tools like a power drill or box cutter. The design follows the existing design principles of the Orbita.

## Project Goal
Our goal is to implement an open-source hardware approach for the Playtronica Orbita. The primary aim is to develop a comprehensive manual/documentation explaining how to integrate the electronic components provided by Playtronica into a music interface designed by us. We are committed to making this process accessible for educational purposes and budget-friendly, enabling anyone to reconstruct it with a limited number of components.

Components provided by Playtronica for this project include sensors, a Raspberry Pi, a motor, a motor belt, magnets, USB-media, and USB-power components.

## Project Plan Summary
The project will follow several steps, ranging from concept creation to final presentation:

1. **Introduction to the Project and Needs**: Understanding project requirements and identifying problems.
2. **Concept Design**: Theoretical concept development and translating concepts into designs.
3. **Production Planning**: Planning for "ObiOrbitar" production and decision-making for the second concept "Orbitime".
4. **Prototyping**: This includes the creation of a Bill of Materials (BOM), determining necessary tools for production, procuring the BOM and Orbita Kit, assembling, and making necessary adjustments during the prototyping phase.
5. **Technical Documentation**: Designing the format and templates for documentation, creating an index of product documentation, drafting manuals and assembly guidelines, and developing drawings and templates for both "ObiOrbitar" and "Orbitime".
6. **Video Production**: Creating instructional videos to supplement written documentation.
7. **Final Presentation**: Implementing final changes and releasing documentation.

## Project Deliverables
- **Open Source Hardware Approach Outcome: ObiOrbita**: A working prototype of an open-source, affordable, and user-friendly version of the Orbita.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Including an index of product documentation, architecture, assembly instructions, Bill of Materials (BOM), Tools, design files (CAD), and video.
- **GitHub Collaboration**: Our GitHub repository will serve as a collaborative workspace where we share our design files and documentation, allowing community contributions.
