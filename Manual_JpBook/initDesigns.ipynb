    "# Initial Design Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "During the brainstorming phase, two possible and realizable design approaches have been developed: First, the ObiOrbita and second, the OrbiTime. The criteria that were included for finding a solution were: It must consist of components that everyone has at home or that are easy to obtain (e.g. from a local hardware store). It must be cost effective so that this is not a hurdle. In addition, the device must be easy to rebuild, so that no special tools and no special craftsmanship or technical knowledge are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ObiOrbita\n",
    "\n",
    "ObiOrbita is based on simplicity and a budget. In addition to the electric kit from Playtronica, the centerpiece of this design is a turntable from Ikea called *Snudda*. All the remaining components, which are mainly made of wood and complementary materials can be easily purchased at the hardware store. \n",
    "\n",
    "## OrbiTime\n",
    "\n",
    "OrbiTime presents an upside-down approach of the original Orbita. Basically, it is a more creative solution approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its easier implementability and fewer unknowns to consider, the ObiOrbita design approach was chosen. In the following sections, the strategy, the results and the implementation of a first Open Source Hardware version of the ObiOrbita is described.\n",
